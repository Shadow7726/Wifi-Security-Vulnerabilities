## **2. Wi-Fi Enterprise Overview**  

### **Description**  
Wi-Fi Enterprise refers to wireless networks deployed in business environments, offering robust authentication, enhanced security, and centralized management. It uses **WPA2-Enterprise** or **WPA3-Enterprise** protocols and often integrates with authentication servers like RADIUS.  

### **Key Features**  
- **Centralized Authentication:** Uses 802.1X with RADIUS for user and device validation.  
- **Scalability:** Supports large numbers of users and devices.  
- **Network Segmentation:** Allows role-based access control with VLANs.  
- **Advanced Security:** Uses certificates (e.g., EAP-TLS) and mutual authentication.  
- **Management Tools:** Centralized monitoring and control via Wi-Fi controllers.
